# OslynHunt2024

 Welcome to OSLYN+Kirbs Hunt 2024! This is a puzzle hunt similar to Galactic Hunt and other online puzzle hunts. A couple of things to note:

- There are 6 puzzles, plus a meta-puzzle. Two puzzles are unlocked initially, and each completed puzzle unlocks another.
- Every bit of text on a puzzle is part of the puzzle. That includes the title, flavour text and (obviously) the puzzle body.
- Answers only contain alphabetic characters and are not case-sensitive.
- This is a fully client-side hunt, meaning there's no server hosting this, no timer, and no leaderboard. You can (and should) do this puzzle in a team, but there's nothing to track that for you. Each of you will have to enter the answers in your browser to unlock more puzzles.
- You do not need to inspect element, look at the source or view the code for the repository in order to solve the puzzles. You can't cheat like that, either. Even though the answers are validated client-side, they aren't stored in plaintext.
- The puzzles lean somewhat pop-culture-heavy in references and themes.
